## Hangman: The Classic Word Guessing Application in Python 🐍

Get ready to test your vocabulary and have some spooky fun with this Python implementation of Hangman!   This project allows you to play the classic word-guessing application, keeping you entertained and guessing letters until you save the poor hangman (or meet your doom!).  💀

### Features 🌟

* Guess letters to reveal a hidden word, one letter at a time. 
* Choose from a pre-defined word list or even add your own custom words for a personalized challenge! 🆕

### Technologies Used 💻

* Python: The core programming language for building the game logic. 🐍 

### Getting Started 🚀

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x installed on your system 🖥️.
* (Optional) Libraries for sound effects (e.g., Pygame). 🎶

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manjeetbarman/Hangman-Application-Using-Python.git
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt ⌨️. 
   - Navigate to the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd hangman-python
     ```

   - Run the main script:

     ```bash
     python hangman.py
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to start playing!  🎉

### Usage 🛠️

* The game will display a hidden word with dashes representing unguessed letters. ➖
* Guess letters one by one. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. 
* If your guess is wrong, a body part is added to the hangman illustration. The more wrong guesses, the closer you are to losing!  💀
* Keep guessing until you reveal the entire word or run out of guesses (and the hangman meets his fate!).  😱
